# Film Query

## Summary
User is presented with a menu. They can choose to look up a film by film id number or keyword. If they choose to look up a film by id number they can then choose to see a more detailed view or exit to the main menu. Invalid entries out of range for id number or non-matching keywords are noticed and the user asked to choose again. At anytime the user may exit from the main menu

## Technology Used
Eclipse, MySql, Atom, Maven, Java,
Also, a pre-created and installed fictitious and humorous database of films.

## Coding
Prepared statements to search a database from Java.
SELECT ON and JOIN to access multiple tables for a single search.
Creating Objects from databases. Creating lists of Objects from databases. User input to access database information, and anticipating desired search requests.

## Lessons Learned
An understanding of interacting with databases using Java and terminal searches.

## Future Improvements
• Pack two searches inside one method for more DRY code.
• Add in a search and return for film condition and number of copies for each film ID queried.
• Write JUnit tests.
